    <string name="welcome">Welcome</string>
    <string name="welcome2">\t This application is a list of simple and powerful techniques to help you deal with spiritual problems such as stress, fears, doubts, intrusive thoughts, limiting beliefs, and destructive attitudes. All of the techniques are well-known and time-tested. As a rule, they are taken from NLP and the scientific works of Zhivorad Slavinsky. This tool will save you time, effort, and money. You are not required to have deep knowledge of psychology and subconscious programming. We wish you success in your workouts!</string>

    <string name="theory">Description</string>
    <string name="theory1">\t The "Spin" by Zhivrad Slavinsky is one of the most trivial and effective techniques that can exist. It is performed in a matter of seconds, and the result is felt after only a couple of minutes. This tool is effective for removing any negative charge from past episodes. All you have to do is identify the painful episode and rate the feeling associated with it on a 10-point scale. Everything simple is genius!</string>
    <string name="theory2">\t Our psyche has a wonderful property: the smaller and farther an object is, the less it means to us. If something does not matter to us, it does not bother us. A small point is always less attractive than something large. So one sure way to solve an emotional problem is to mechanically downgrade its importance through imaginary distance, reduction, and dissolution. It is simple as hell!</string>
    <string name="theory3">\t The main cause of any anxiety is overemphasis. That is why it is good to be able to lower it. Comparing importance is one way to reduce the importance of what is troubling. Essentially, importance is the sum total of all negativity, including fear, disbelief in oneself, idealization, doubt, and more. To perform this technique, simply compare what is important in the past, present, and future in relation to the problem.</string>
    <string name="theory4">\t Back in the 1960s, scientists discovered the so-called "Diary Effect. What is deeply realized ceases to affect our psyche. For this reason, the habit of journaling can do much in terms of awareness, mental balance and spiritual maturity. But when keeping a diary for maximum results, it is advisable to practice writing out into aspects, where the problem is formulated and broken down into its components.</string>
    <string name="theory5">\t Any inner conflict involves the struggle between two opposing motives, desires, beliefs, and goals. In fact, many spiritual problems are caused by dualities. So working with the polarities is another way to free oneself from what is troubling. But, as a rule, it is not just one pair of dualities that creates inner conflict. There may be several of them. For this reason, it is advisable to consider more possible pairs related to the problem.</string>
    <string name="theory6">\t In our lives we often need to set goals and achieve them. But the end result and the cost of achieving it depend very much on the right goal setting. The following five questions will help you set goals and increase your productivity. As Sun Tzu said, strategy without tactics is the slowest path to victory, and tactics without strategy is just vanity before defeat.</string>

    <string name="theory7">\t Our lives depend a great deal on our beliefs. After all, most of our actions are done automatically under the control of our subconscious mind. Often we prevent ourselves from achieving what we want with our stereotypes and lack of faith in our abilities. This technique will help you loosen your limiting beliefs and get closer to the desired result. Often a successful person is distinguished only by a freer and more confident mindset. </string>

    <string name="theory8">\t We can think of what is not working for us as a problem and as a task. When we think of a situation as a problem, we focus more on what is not working and how unpleasant it all is for us. When we think of a situation as a problem, we focus more on finding a solution. In most cases, thinking of the situation as a task is much more helpful. Here is a suggested way to quickly move a situation from a "problem" to a "task.</string>
    <string name="theory9">\t The Anchor technique is a tool that allows us to quickly create conditioned reflexes and use them to our advantage. For example, to write down a good mood in order to activate it at the right time and in the right place. To perform this technique, it is enough to be in the right state, make an anchor by touch or touch, and trigger it by repeating an earlier touch. Note that the anchoring should be as sensitive as possible.</string>


    <string name="theory10">\t In everyday life, we always have to make choices. Often our choices can make a big difference in our future. This technique works well for cases where you have several choices, but have difficulty choosing one. Choices on the Line of Time are good for making long-term predictions of the consequences of each choice. It all comes down to sorting out some issues and looking at the situation more objectively.</string>
    <string name="theory11">\t Fear is actually a very useful thing-it keeps us out of dangerous places. A child gets burned and does not try to stick his hand into the fire again. Or a passing car beeped loudly and the child realized that these big iron things must be feared. But at the same time, fear must be practiced in order to be able to control oneself in a critical situation - during a fire, excessive fear of fire can be paralyzing, and excessive fear of cars can create a phobia of crossing the street. This technique helps you learn to control your fear.</string>
    <string name="theory12">\t Sometimes we can not solve do it or do not. For example: to buy or not to buy a car, to marry or not to marry, to change jobs or not to change jobs, and so on. And often you get "hang-ups": it is difficult to evaluate the benefits and losses of each action. NLP has a little model called Cartesian coordinates to make the choice easier. So, you want to make a choice, for example, "to buy or not to buy a car. Imagine a square divided into four parts. On one axis will be "I will get it - I will lose it", on the other "I will do it - I will not do it".</string>
